# Udemy Course Work

This repository serves as storage for my code and other courses work from classes taken on [Udemy.](https://www.udemy.com/)

Directories indicate the type/classification of the work they contain.  Sub-directories are labeled according to the course name, as displayed on Unity.

e.g. - [`NLP/Introduction_to_Natural_Language_Processing/`](./NLP/Introduction_to_Natural_Language_Processing/) contains my course work for a class titled `Introduction_to_Natural_Language_Processing`.  This course can be categorized as `NLP`.
